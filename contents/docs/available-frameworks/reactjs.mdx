## Reactjs Template (Include Tailwindcss, TypeScript & JavaScript)

This is a [React.js](https://react.dev/) project bootstrapped with [`vitejs`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md).

## Technologies Used

- [React.js (Typescript)](https://react.dev/)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro/)

## Features

The features included in this project template are:

- Project Architecture.
- Authentication.
- Customize `React Hooks`.
- Some custom functions that [I](https://github.com/nuflakbrr) often use.

### Architecture Projects

There are several important points related to how to run a proper architecture project. For this case study, I have created a customized blank project template that I have implemented how to organize a good architecture project so that it looks tidy.

└── vite.config.js # or vite.config.ts
```

#### Common Folder

The `Common` folder is located in `/src/components/`. So what does it contain? The `Common` folder contains small components, such as: buttons, dropdowns, etc.

#### Mixins Folder

The `Mixins` folder is located in `/src/components/`. So what does it contain? The `Mixins` folder contains components that are a combination of small components from the `Common` folder. Such as: navbar (which contains some common things such as buttons, dropdowns, etc.).

#### Containers Folder

The `Containers` folder is located in `/src/components/`. So what does it contain? The `Containers` folder contains a combination of the `Common` folder and the page itself which form 1 page. 1 page 1 `Containers` folder to keep it tidy.

If 1 container has several sections, then you must separate and put them in the `components` folder but still in 1 `Containers` folder. Such as: `/src/components/Containers/Home/components`.

### Authentication

This project template already uses authentication using `React Context`. If the user has authenticated, the user cannot access the `login` or `register` page again.

### React Hooks Customization

You can use, and add your own custom `React Hooks` to the `/src/hooks` folder that has been provided. There is an example of `React Hooks` customization for `Data Fetching` using [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro).

6. **Start Building Your Project**: After BikinProject generate the starter project, you can start building your project.

7. **Copy Environment Variable**: Copy the `environment variable` with the following command

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

8. **Open Development Server**: Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser and see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `/src/components/Containers/Home/Home.(jsx/tsx)`. The page updates automatically as you edit the file.
