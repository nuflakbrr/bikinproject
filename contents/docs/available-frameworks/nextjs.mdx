## Nextjs Template (Include Tailwindcss, Customize ESLint Rules, TypeScript & JavaScript)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro/)

## Features

The features included in this project template are:

- Project Architecture.
- Authentication.
- Customize `React Hooks`.
- Some custom functions that [I](https://github.com/nuflakbrr) often use.

### Architecture Projects

There are several important points related to how to run a proper architecture project. For this case study, I have created a customized blank project template that I have implemented how to organize a good architecture project so that it looks tidy.

```plaintext
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── app/
│   │   └── about/
│   │   └── api/
│   │   └── auth/
│   │   └── contact/
│   │   └── favicon.ico
│   │   └── globals.css
│   │   └── layout.jsx # or layout.tsx
│   │   └── loading.jsx # or loading.tsx

└── package.json
└── postcss.config.js
└── README.md
└── tailwind.config.js # or tailwind.config.ts
└── tsconfig.json # TypeScript only
```

#### Common Folder

The `Common` folder is located in `/src/components/`. So what does it contain? The `Common` folder contains small components, such as: buttons, dropdowns, etc.

#### Mixins Folder

The `Mixins` folder is located in `/src/components/`. So what does it contain? The `Mixins` folder contains components that are a combination of small components from the `Common` folder. Such as: navbar (which contains some common things such as buttons, dropdowns, etc.).

#### Containers Folder

The `Containers` folder is located in `/src/components/`. So what does it contain? The `Containers` folder contains a combination of the `Common` folder and the page itself which form 1 page. 1 page 1 `Containers` folder to keep it tidy.

If 1 container has several sections, then you must separate and put them in the `components` folder but still in 1 `Containers` folder. Such as: `/src/components/Containers/Home/components`.

### Authentication

This project template already uses authentication using `React Context`. If the user has authenticated, the user cannot access the `login` or `register` page again.

### React Hooks Customization

You can use, and add your own custom `React Hooks` to the `/src/hooks` folder that has been provided. There is an example of `React Hooks` customization for `Data Fetching` using [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro).

## Getting Started

This template is available on BikinProject! How to use this template, follow these simple steps:

1. **Install BikinProject**: Start by installing BikinProject on your machine.

```bash
  npx bikinproject@latest
```

2. **Tell BikinProject Where to Create the Project**: Input a directory where you want to create your project.

```bash
  ┌   create-bikinproject-app
  │
  ◇  Where should we create your project?
  └  ./your-project # Input your project name, e.g. my-project or .
```

3. **Choose a Starter Project**: Choose a starter project that suits your needs.

```bash
  ┌   create-bikinproject-app
  │
  ◇  Where should we create your project?
  │  ./your-project
  │
  ◇  Pick a project type within "./your-project"
  │  ● Next.js App Router (Tailwind + TypeScript)
  │  ○ Next.js App Router (Tailwind + JavaScript)
  │  ○ etc.
  └  # Select a project type by using the arrow keys
```

4. **Choose include install dependencies**: Choose to install dependencies or not.

  ◇  Install dependencies? (currently only NPM is supported)
  │  ● Yes / ○ No
  └  # Select Yes or No by using the arrow keys
```

5. **Wait for BikinProject to Create the Project**: Wait for BikinProject to create the project for you.

<Note title="Note" type="note">
  If you choose to install dependencies, BikinProject will install the necessary dependencies for you. Please wait for the installation to complete.
</Note>

```bash
  ┌   create-bikinproject-app
  │
  ◇  Where should we create your project?
  │  ./your-project

  ◇  Pick a project type within "./your-project"
  │  Next.js App Router (Tailwind + TypeScript)
  │
  ◇  Install dependencies? (currently only NPM is supported)
  │  No
  │
  ◇  ⏳ Creating project...
  │
  ◇  🎉 Project Created!
  │
  ◇  Next steps. ───────────────╮
  │                             │
  │  cd ./your-project          │
  │  npm install                │

  └  Have a Problems? Report to https://github.com/nuflakbrr/bikinproject/issues
```

6. **Start Building Your Project**: After BikinProject generate the starter project, you can start building your project.

7. **Copy Environment Variable**: Copy the `environment variable` with the following command

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

8. **Open Development Server**: Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `/src/components/Containers/Home/Home.(jsx/tsx)`. The page updates automatically as you edit the file.

## API Routes

[API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed at [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `/src/app/api/hello.(js/ts)`.

The `/src/app/api` folder is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
